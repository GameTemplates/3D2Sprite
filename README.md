# 3D2Sprite

3D2Sprite is a simple and free application for Windows and Linux to make 2D sprites from your 3D models and use them to create an Isometric, 2.5D or 3D look and feel in your 2D projects.

The tool is written in AppGameKit2 for my personal needs, never meant to be shared so keep that in mind when use the software or take a look inside the source code.
